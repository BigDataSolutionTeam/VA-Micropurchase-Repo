## ***Ad Hoc, LLC has been selected for award of the API Outreach Microconsulting effort.***

## **Microconsulting Work Statement – API Outreach**

## Background
The Lighthouse program is moving VA towards an Application Programming Interface (API) first driven digital enterprise, which will establish the next generation open management platform for Veterans and accelerate transformation in VA's core functions, such as Health, Benefits, Burial and Memorials. This platform will be a system for designing, developing, publishing, operating, monitoring, analyzing, iterating and optimizing VA’s API ecosystem.

## The Play
As the Lighthouse Product Owner, I must have a repeatable process to communicate with internal and external stakeholders the availability of existing, new, and future APIs so that the information can be consumed for the benefit of the Veteran.  This outreach/evangelism effort may be different depending on the API type.

## Deliverable
A defined and repeatable strategy/process to evangelize existing, new, and future APIs to VA's stakeholders as products.  This may be in the form of charts, graphics, narrative, or combination thereof.  Ultimately, VA wants the best format to accurately communicate the process/strategy.  This strategy/process may be unique to each type of API.

Deliverable shall be submitted to VA's GitHub Repo. 

## Definition of Done
-  Deliverable that accurately and clearly demonstrates a repeatable strategy/process
-  Submission to GitHub

## Time Box
VA anticipates a 2 week iteration to be sufficient.

## Disclaimer
In performance of this effort, the contractor shall not perform a function that requires access to a VA system or VA sensitive information (e.g., system administrator privileged access to a VA system, or contractor systems or processes that utilize VA sensitive information).  Additionally, the contractor shall not connect one or more contractor-owned IT devices to a VA internal trusted network.  Finally, this acquisition does not involve the storage, generating, transmitting, or exchanging of VA sensitive information.
