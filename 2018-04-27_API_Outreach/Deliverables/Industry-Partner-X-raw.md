DRAFT Conversation Guide - New Industry Partners

## Welcome and Opening Remarks (5 minutes)

[When the participant is ready, the moderator will begin the session with the following introduction.]

  

Thank you for joining us today. As we talked about before, the VA is considering providing VA data in the form of APIs. We’re working with the VA to explore this option and talk to potential users of this API to better understand how the VA could implement an API solution that satisfies the needs of consumers of VA data.

  

Are you familiar with APIs? (Application Programming Interfaces)

  

An API, or Application Programming Interface, is a flexible way to give and receive information by allowing software systems to communicate with each other. In this case, the VA could provide a set of tools for providing appeals data that gives your developers all the building blocks necessary to automate collection of appeals data directly from VA’s system to your own.

  

Before we begin, I’d like to make a few things clear and explain how the session will work:

-   There are no right or wrong answers — and I won’t be offended by any opinions you express.
    
-   [NAME] will be taking notes. We have to share what we learn from you with the rest of our team.
    
-   This conversation will last approximately 45 minutes to 1 hour.
    
-   Your participation in this discussion is voluntary. You may stop at any time. Your name will not be shared outside of this research team.
    
-   If it’s ok with you, we’d like to record this conversation today. Recording our discussion will help us capture everything you say accurately.
    
-   Remember, there are no right or wrong answers. We are here to learn from you. We really want to hear what you think. No idea or opinion is incorrect.
    

  

Do you have any questions at this stage?

Working with USAJobs, ive heard on the veteran side that it takes a lot of time to apply through USAJobs. When I got out of college, it took an hour and a half to apply for 3 jobs.

  

I can say that it fits within...some of the things we’re tryign to experiment with. Our mission is to to try to help people get jobs and anything we can do to make that experience better across any network, but vets come at a priority on that side

  

We are experimenting with a verification in other ways, employment and background verification. For Vets fraud and also helps tehm get jobs faster hoepfully, because it makes that

  

I would imagine that employers that are asking questions about veterans status would benefit from this…”I’d have to do some user research on it”

Something like that piqued my interest, bc i think tits important and aligned with teh things that we’re working on in other answers:

  

Things I don’t know:

-   No answers on volume, how many vets in our system right now.
    
-   Do vets have resumes?
    
-   Growing demand from our employers and from our side to make things more apparent in job applications
    

  

Could we ping some end point at some point to ask: hey is this a veteran and then be able to verify in our system?

-   L: Great q. Don’t have a timeline that I can share. Looking for a market,
    

  

Ilan’s vision:

-   My questions are around timing. If you said tomorrow, hey theres an API endpoint that you could hit, when could you being doing that and then showing it, i wouldnt have an answer because of a bandwidth and resources
    
-   But if we had some lead time to socialize and talk to product, which it sounds like we do, then we could deliver and be ready to start testing immediately as soon as its ready
    
-   From a business perspective, its always better to have all that information up front “to socialize colleagues”
    

-   Needs more information on timing, expectations
    
-   We do these partnerships, one of the big things, if we’re going to spend time building it, you’re going to have to use it. Are there commercial potential? Or is it simply a technical integration? Legal factors are also important to iron out.
    
-   More in the form of a verification: we believe that X percent of our job seekers are veterans. Dig into their own database, which employers want to hire to make the case for veterans data integration being important.
    
-   Which age groups are looking for jobs, which are best represented and then mash with the VA to see where it mashes with their data.
    
-   Can you share any content and marketing pieces that we can share with these teams?
    

-   There’s absolutely interest in this
    

L: maybe we should schedule another follow up in two weeks

  

Maybe we need to get folks from marketing, etc to get into the profiles of veterans and what we’re seeing.

What I can help with is further down the line around technical specs and timing of development

  

“Usually there needs to be some kind of number behind it. If we do this, how many job seekers are we going to affect, how many employers are we going to affect.”
