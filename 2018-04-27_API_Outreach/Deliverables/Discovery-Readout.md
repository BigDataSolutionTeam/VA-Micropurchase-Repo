# Industry Partner X

## Willingness to integrate

### Current Veteran products

-   Work to identify Veterans on the back end to better match them to employers
    
-   Currently data is upload by Vets manually and Industry Partner X pulls from Resumes
    

### Benefit of Integration with VA APIs

-   “Our mission is to to try to help people get jobs and anything we can do to make that experience better across any network...but vets come at a priority on that side.”
    
- "it's really help any veterans coming to Industry Partner X, you know, figuring out what their backgrounds were in the military, you know, learning more about how that translates into civilian roles”
    
-   Employers come to them with an interest in hiring veterans
    

### VA API Data Needs

-   Use case: Veteran verification or identification data to more easily surface veterans to potential employers
    
-   Use case: Data on Veterans eligible for work
    
-   Use case: Data on when Veterans will be leaving the military to target them to help them start their job search earlier
    

-  “getting to the veteran 12 months before they're transitioned out gives them enough time to look, prepare, figure out”
    

-   Use case: Data on skill sets to match to their own keyword skill sets. Help with skill set transferral
    
-   Use case: skills from Onet online (Bureau of Labor and Statistics): [https://www.onetonline.org/](https://www.onetonline.org/)
    
-   Use case: Using VA data to surface “Veteran-friendly” businesses and organizations
    

### Baseline Metrics

Willingness to integrate: 7:

-   If it was me, I’m saying a 10, but it just depends on like how we really, I mean have to have them in the room for them to put their two cents and things from like a corporate communications legal standpoint and all that.”
    

Impact: 10

## Integration Process

### Ideal expectations for VA partnership

-   VA as a stamp of approval for Industry Partner X
    

-   I think if there was the ability to partner with apis and you know, have that kind of like self promotion and just having a partnership with the veterans affairs I think would give Industry Partner X credibility that this thing will grow like a wildfire because it's like they have a government stamp of approval plus we’re Industry Partner X”
    

-   Being able to funnel more veterans toward their site with VA credibility
    

-   I think working on a partnership via API and just, you know, sharing information in terms of like what could we do better, how does this look, you know, how do we get plugged into the databases of veterans because every veteran we add to Industry Partner X, that’s an easier way for them to get a job. So I think any type of API that has a candidate flow as well, would be extremely beneficial”
    
-   Lots of statements about making the case to the VA about how they’re the premier job source compared to other companies
    

### Factors that go into integration decision making

-   Expectations
    

-   “We do these partnerships, one of the big things, if we’re going to spend time building it, you’re going to have to use it. Are there commercial potential? Or is it simply a technical integration?”
    

-   Timeline
    

-   “But if we had some lead time to socialize and talk to product, which it sounds like we do, then we could deliver and be ready to start testing immediately as soon as it is ready”
    

-   Communications/legal:
    

-  “Yes. Communications. They're very...you know it's a big, it's a big company. So it's like, say less and you'll get in trouble less type of thing”
    

### Preconceived notions about government data

-   We tried to get it from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, but we just kept going around. So was like one of those things like you're knock on a door and then they say, go on, go knock on this door, and then it was...”
    
-   “usually when you think of the government and from what I dealt with, with bureau of Labor statistics, it's like a vault and it's like you, you try to reach out to be like, hey listen, you guys might be, we're essentially the Google for jobs. Anyone that types in a job search, every job from every website, um, imaginable is going to come to Industry Partner X. So we're like a one stop shop for veterans. Any veteran that needs a job, they can type in into the what and where. And here's a list of jobs that come up now. The more veterans that we have in our database, the more jobs we can get them. The more veterans that we have that are authenticated, the more our clients are going to rely on us to supply them with veterans because the biggest thing that we see is that there's a lot of clients that want to hire veterans.”
    

## Recommendations

### Outreach

-   Personal outreach
    

-  “I don't know if we went to them or they went to us.”
    

-   Give them lead time to make API development a priority
    

### Branding Strategy

-   Describe benefit for Industry Partner X’s customers (companies that approach them for recruiting).
    
-   Better data on Vets makes Industry Partner X look like a better choice for Vets for job search.
    
-   Put a number on the impact.
    
-   Describe how this partnership would give them a competitive advantage in attracting Vets to their site.
    

### Marketing Materials / Collateral

-   Put names of outside developers using on API portal site
    
-   Come armed with materials to evangelize other colleagues on benefits
    

-   “Usually there needs to be some kind of number behind it. If we do this, how many job seekers are we going to affect, how many employers are we going to affect.”

## Insights

### Benefit of Integration with VA APIs

-   Currently use VA and Veteran data, however, there are many pain points in the process that could be solved by API integration:
    

-   Uploading documents leads to bad quality, missing data, mistakes in uploads. Veterans don’t know what data to upload.
    
-   “Source of truth” issue
    
-   Time spent reviewing Veteran documents
    
-   Mistakes in adjudication process due to bad data
    

### VA API Data Needs

-   We need “data to make sure that the people asking for preferential treatment are meeting the requirements.”
    

-   DD214 data
    
-   30% or more service related disability = CPF Vets
    
-   TP Vets = Particular medal, served during a particular period of time, particular type of discharge
    
-   FS15 for 10 point preference, spousal or widow preference, parental preference
    

## Integration process

### Factors that go into API decision making

-   CIO and overall roadmap priority
    

-   “Generally its in service of, we want to have some piece of data because we have a roadmap of problems we’re trying to solve and functionality we want to offer and features we’re trying to build and as we come to those things, we evaluate whether we have the data, can we get the data from somewhere else? Can we save the users time?” (16:27)
    
-   “Sometimes we’re aware that we need an API...but it’s not a small thing of just: oh, we’re just going to do that and get approval for that, it’s part of a more massive bit of work that we’re just not tackling for whatever reason.” (18:40)
    

  

-   Gathering institutional buy-in
    

-   OPM needs to have a plan for maintaining the data
    
-   Success stories
    
-   Data relevancy and maps to their existing data and priorities
    

-   “I have to do a fair amount of selling that we’re not trying to reinvent a new wheel over here, we’re trying to relate this to stuff we’re already kind of...a source of truth for some of these things.”
    

-   Accuracy, reliability of dataset
    

-   “The hard thing with OPM is when we put our stamp of approval on something, it has to be government wide and it carries this weight that maybe it doesn’t maybe if you’re just playing with something or prototyping and want to see how it goes. We don’t have that level of flexibility. It would need to be vetted that it’s actually really useful for Veterans, and it needs to be complete, that it would match up with our competencies and other large datasets that we have.” (20:40)
    

-   Trust in data source
    

  

-   Security plan needs to be in place and can slow down the process.
    

### Preconceived notions about VA APIs

-   Data may not be relevant
    

-   “I guess being a data guy and knowing that the USAJobs has API, but we have a ton of APIs that are not always looked at as open data APIs or data that is going to be consumed...essentially I expect everyone to have an API nowadays, but is it relevant to what we do and is it data that our users can use to make a decision off of. That’s a whole different aspect of the question.”
    
-   “There may be information that I don’t know about your publishing of APIs, but my expectations are low for US government right now, unfortunately. But I welcome to have my expectations blown away.” (12:12)
    

  

-   Data may not be the “source of truth” (accurate, quality)
    

-   “It was 2014-15 was the last time we reached out to VA and DOD to find where the source of truth existed of the data put into the DD214 forms. They both didn’t know and pointed at each other, so we’re really excited to hear that there may be something.”
    

  

-   Projects may get derailed and data disappears
    

-   “The conversation came up a few times, but it went nowhere.” (13:30)
    

# Recommendations

### Outreach strategy

-   Direct personal contact with OPM
    

-   “We consume Onet data through an API, but that’s not PII. If the API is going to involve PII, we need to have a direct personal contact at that agency.”
    

  

-   Work with key stakeholders and CIO to get the data prioritized on the roadmap
    

-   “Sometimes we’re aware that we need an API...but it’s not a small thing of just: oh, we’re just going to do that and get approval for that, it’s part of a more massive bit of work that we’re just not tackling for whatever reason.” (18:40)
    

  

-   Give OPM the data they need to make the argument for integration
    

  

-   Offer resources to work with them throughout integration process
    

### Branding strategy

-   Other agencies are successfully using this data
    
-   This data is reliable, up-to-date and not going anywhere.
    
-   OPM can confidently put their stamp of approval on this data.
    

### Marketing Materials / Collateral

-   Publicize who else is using the API
    

-   Developer portal
    
-   Press releases and one-pagers
    

-   Developer portal should prominently explain what the Lighthouse project is
    
-   Portal should prominently communicate the types of API offerings
    
-   Portal should give users information on who to connect with to guide them through implementation
    
-   Differentiation around access depending on type of data within developer portal design
    

-   “I’m looking right now on your open data site and I don’t see a list of APIs for example.”
    
-   “Well I think the things that we would be interested in probably wouldn’t be publicly available. The things that we’re interested in are like confirmation that somebody is a veteran or their personal PII which wouldn’t be immediately available.”
