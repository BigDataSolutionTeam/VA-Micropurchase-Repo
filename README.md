# **Posting of DRAFT Microconsulting Work Statements**

We have posted five draft Lighthouse Microconsulting work statements and are looking for feedback via comments within each issue or email (mark.junda@va.gov and david.melton@va.gov).  We are interested to know whether these are scoped appropriately for the micropurchase threshold, what additional information you would require to further you understanding, and any other feedback you can provide.

## Due Date
Please provide your input by March 16 @ 5pm.  Include your company name, POC info, and DUNS.  This information can be provided separately from the comments if submitted via comments.
